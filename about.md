Iâ€™m a Software Engineering and a member of the Engineering & Innovation team for LATAM at Microsoft. My expertise includes the Visual Studio IDE, Team Foundation Server, Visual Studio Team Services, DevOps practices and Azure.  I engage with customers to help them maximize their investments in DevOps and new technologies adoption in Azure.  Prior to Microsoft I worked for 13 years in IT consulting, building solutions to business problems on top of Microsoft technologies.
